# Balloon Launch 1

## Purpose of dev-avr Branch

- This branch allows people who don't have arduino dues but
do have arduino unos to run the code on the board and contribute code

- Some features might not work (NOP'd, like using radio/gps/etc) and
  would be purposefully removed/replaced with printlns, but the overall
  due architechture in master should theoretically be "runnable" on a uno as well
